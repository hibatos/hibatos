### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer from Germany.
In my day to day job I work as a ServiceNow developer,  
developing custom modules and processes.

In my freetime I work on other projects, from embedded controller programming and hardware development to woodworking and 3D design.

For any questions, contact me by email (address mentioned in my profile).
